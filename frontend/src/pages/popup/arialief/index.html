            <h3>Magnesium Glycinate</h3>
            <p>
              Magnesium Glycinate is a highly bioavailable form of magnesium
              that supports nerve function and muscle relaxation. It is known to
              help ease sciatic discomfort and nerve tension, calming the
              nervous system and reducing symptoms associated with nerve
              inflammation.

            <h3>Alpha Lipoic Acid</h3>
            <p>
              Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) is a powerful antioxidant that protects
              nerve cells from oxidative damage. It plays a crucial role in
              reducing inflammation and supporting nerve function, making it
              particularly beneficial for sciatic discomfort and nerve function.

            <h3>Butcher's Broom (Ruscus aculeatus)</h3>
            <p>
              Butcher's Broom root extract is traditionally used to support
              blood circulation and reduce inflammation. It helps alleviate
              discomfort caused by poor blood supply to the nerves and is known
              for its benefits in easing sciatic discomfort and improving nerve
              function.

            <h3>L-Carnitine</h3>
            <p>
              L-Carnitine is an amino acid that supports cellular energy
              production and promotes nerve regeneration. It is effective in
              reducing nerve tension and sciatic discomfort by improving nerve
              repair and function.

              Coenzyme Q10 is a vitamin-like compound that supports cellular
              energy production. It is known for its ability to quickly
              penetrate damaged nerves and restore their function, making it a
              valuable component in alleviating sciatic discomfort and restoring
              nerve function.

                Arialief stands out due to its unique formulation that combines
                Magnesium Glycinate with powerful ingredients like Alpha Lipoic
                Acid, Butcher’s Broom, L-Carnitine, and Turmeric. These
                ingredients work together to relieve the
                <b>burning, tingling, and numbness</b> caused by Neuropathy,
                reduce nerve inflammation, and support long-term nerve health.
                Additionally, Arialief helps
                <b>soothe overactive nerves, restore sensation, and promote

              <p>
                Arialief stands out from other supplements due to its
                comprehensive approach and strong scientific backing. While many
                products focus only on temporary relief, Arialief targets the
                root causes of Neuropathy—helping to calm overactive nerves,
                reduce nerve pain, and restore sensation. Its ingredients,
                backed by clinical studies, support healthy nerve function and
                have been reported by users to provide significant improvements
                in a short period.

                A: Every person is different, but Arialief® is remarkably
                effective for nearly everyone who’s tried it. It contains
                clinically-backed ingredients with tons of evidence. But if for

                As for nourishing & supporting proper nerve function, this won’t
                happen overnight, our formula uses the most bioavailable form of
                each ingredient so that the ingredients absorb into your system
                faster than other supplements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some customers have seen results in as little as a week, while
                for most it will take 3-6 months to get the best results.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each case is different - and a number of factors can influence
                the amount of time it’ll take to see improvement. We strongly
                recommend taking Arialief® for at least 4-6 months for your best
                chance at success.

                formula, it won’t work for everyone. Which is why we offer a

                work for you, we give you an entire year to request a refund

                physician or pharmacist first. Because some prescriptions can
                temporarily inhibit the body’s ability to absorb nutrients, we
                recommend taking Arialief® either 30 mins before or after taking
                your prescriptions. This will ensure more of the ingredients in
                Arialief® are absorbed into your system.

                <li>
                  <b>Hypromellose (Vegetable Capsule):</b> This plant-derived
                  capsule material ensures rapid dissolution for quick release
                  and absorption of the active ingredients, catering to
                  vegetarians and health-conscious consumers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Microcrystalline Cellulose:</b> Acts as an excellent filler
                  and texturizer, helping to stabilize the formulation and
                  ensure uniformity in each capsule for consistent delivery and
                  efficacy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Magnesium Stearate:</b> Used as a flow agent, it improves
                  the manufacturing process by preventing ingredients from
                  sticking to production equipment, thus maintaining the quality
                  and safety of the capsules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Stearic Acid:</b> This fatty acid serves as both an
                  emulsifier and a lubricant, enhancing the mixture of
                  ingredients and contributing to the smooth consistency of the
                  capsules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Silicon Dioxide:</b> Often used as an anti-caking agent, it
                  prevents the ingredients from clumping together, ensuring that
                  each dose contains just the right amount of active
                  ingredients.

                role in supporting the effective absorption and delivery of the
